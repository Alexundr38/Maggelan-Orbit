DESCRIPTION                  = "Orbit Data Files (ODFs) are                   
    produced by the NASA/JPL Multi-Mission Navigation Radio                   
    Metric Data Conditioning Team for use in determining                      
    spacecraft trajectories, gravity fields affecting them,                   
    and radio propagation conditions.  Each ODF consists of                   
    many 36-byte logical records, which fall into 7 primary                   
    groups plus an End-of-File Group.  An ODF usually                         
    contains most groups, but may not have all.  The first                    
    record in each of the 7 primary groups is a header                        
    record; depending on the group, there may be from zero                    
    to many data records following each header.  The ODF is
